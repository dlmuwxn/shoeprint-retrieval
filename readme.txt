Each directory includes files related to the results on corresponding datasets.

Every image in each directory is concatenated by the query image and the top nine shoeprints in the gallery set. Shoeprints from the same shoe with the query image are marked by a red star.

Results.xlsx in each directory lists the ranks of similar shoeprints to each query image on the corresponding dataset. The first column in each sheet lists the filename of each query image and the other columns list ranks of similar shoeprints in the gallery set.
